# Organisational Data Models

APIs **SHOULD** be built and categorised according to the business capabilities they support.

This approach will align the UKHSA API portfolio with the core business functions and value streams of the organisation (e.g. surveillance, monitoring etc), making it easier for internal and external users to find and integrate with APIs that expose known business capabilities.

Organising APIs by [business capability][1] provides a logical structure that facilitates consistent governance and makes it simpler to identify gaps and opportunities for development within the organisationâ€™s API ecosystem.

APIs **SHOULD NOT** be designed around specific application use cases that are not aligned to capabilities and defined organisational [data models][2].

The consistency of the names of entities and attributes across the whole application **MUST** be maintained.
