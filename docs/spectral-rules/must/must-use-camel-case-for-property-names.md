# **MUST** use camel case for property names

Property names **MUST** use [camel-case][1] strings that match this pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9]+(?:[A-Z][a-z0-9]+)*$`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For openapi definitions marked with `info.x-api-type: pygeoapi`, this ruleâ€™s severity is automatically set to `warn` by the `override-severity-pygeoapi` rule. See [2].

| Name | Description |

| camel case | The first letter of the first word **MUST** begin with a lowercase letter, the first letter of each subsequent word **MUST** begin with a capital letter and **MUST NOT** contain any separators between words such as spaces or special characters such as hyphens or underscores. |
