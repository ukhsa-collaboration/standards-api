# **MUST** have info contact email

The `info` object **MUST** have a `contact email` property that contains a valid email address for the responsible team.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For openapi definitions marked with `info.x-api-type: pygeoapi`, this ruleâ€™s severity is automatically set to `warn` by the `override-severity-pygeoapi` rule. See [1].

## Valid Example

```yaml
info:
  ...
  ...
  contact:
    email: 'support.contact@acme.com'
```
